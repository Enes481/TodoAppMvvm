# What is Android Clean Architecture ? 
* ### Clean architecture is a method of software development in which you should be able to identify what a program performs merely by looking at its source code. The programming language, hardware, and software libraries needed to achieve the program’s goal should be rendered obsolete. Like other software design philosophies, Clean architecture aims to provide a cost-effective process for developing quality code that performs better, is easier to alter, and has fewer dependencies

# Why Clean Architecture ? 
### 1. Separation of Concerns: 
 * ### Separation of code in different modules or sections with specific responsibilities making it easier for maintenance and further modification.
### 2.Loose coupling:
* ### flexible code anything can be easily be changed without changing the system
### 3. Easily Testable

# What is MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) ?
### Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface (the view) – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic (the model) so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform. The viewmodel of MVVM is a value converter,[1] meaning the viewmodel is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the viewmodel is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic.[1] The viewmodel may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view.
